# 📊 Data Science Practice  
A collection of hands-on notebooks covering Python, Pandas, NumPy, Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
This repository documents my journey as I build a strong foundation in Data Science, step-by-step.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This repo contains multiple Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of data science:

- **Python Basics** — variables, loops, functions, modules  
- **NumPy & Pandas** — array operations, dataframes, cleaning, merging, grouping  
- **Web Scraping with Pandas** — reading datasets directly from the web, URL loops, combining CSV files  
- **Mini Projects** — real-world style exercises for practice  
- **More topics will be added** as I progress
